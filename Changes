	  work because level=0 [RT#112665].


0.11    2016-01-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [opt] Reduce startup overhead by 4-5ms (16.8ms to 12ms) in normal
	  cases by delay-loading Term::ANSIColor and Time::HiRes.

0.09    2015-06-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Rename module/dist from Log-Any-Adapter-ScreenColoredLevel to
          Log-Any-Adapter-Screen. The old name has roots/ties in Log::Log4perl
          and is longer to type. I don't see the close ties to Log4perl that
          important anymore.


0.08    2015-06-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add default formatter that can prefix elapsed time (and other

0.04    2012-11-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Avoid undef in Term::ANSIColor::color() by avoiding to hit it if color
          is "" (only happens if script is run under global warning [-w]) [RT
          #80685].
