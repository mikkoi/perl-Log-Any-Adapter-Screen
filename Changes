0.140   2018-12-22 (PERLANCAR)

	- Observe NO_COLOR.


0.13    2016-10-04 (PERLANCAR)

	- Observe COLOR environment to explicitly enable/disable color.


0.12    2016-03-04 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Fix logic mistake which causes LOG_LEVEL=trace to not
	  work because level=0 [RT#112665].


0.11    2016-01-02 (PERLANCAR)

	- [opt] Reduce startup overhead by 4-5ms (16.8ms to 12ms) in normal
	  cases by delay-loading Term::ANSIColor and Time::HiRes.


0.10    2015-12-31 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add option: default_level to allow configuring default level.


0.09    2015-06-19 (PERLANCAR)

        - Rename module/dist from Log-Any-Adapter-ScreenColoredLevel to
          Log-Any-Adapter-Screen. The old name has roots/ties in Log::Log4perl
          and is longer to type. I don't see the close ties to Log4perl that
          important anymore.


0.08    2015-06-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add default formatter that can prefix elapsed time (and other
	  stuffs in the future) depending on LOG_PREFIX.

	- [doc] Note about Log::Any proxy object.


0.07    2015-01-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- Refactor so it's easier to patch by Progress::Any::Output::Term*.

        - [ux] Tweak color for warning (blue -> bold blue) to make it more
          readable, like in Log::Any::App.


0.05    2014-02-28 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Update prereqs in dist.ini, depends on Log::Any::Adapter instead of
          the now-excluded-from-CPAN-index Log::Any::Adapter::Util.


0.04    2012-11-08 (SHARYANTO)

        - Avoid undef in Term::ANSIColor::color() by avoiding to hit it if color
          is "" (only happens if script is run under global warning [-w]) [RT
          #80685].


0.03    2011-05-16 (SHARYANTO)
